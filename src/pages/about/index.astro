        <h3>What Lights Camera Teach is becoming</h3>
        <p>
          The project is evolving from a Los Angeles studio teaching model into a global, travel-based
          education hub. Each location offers a new lens for lesson design, rooted in geography,
          culture, and real-world observation.
